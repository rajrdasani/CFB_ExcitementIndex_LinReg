All games have an excitement level besides these two games:
```{r}
cfb[is.na(cfb$excitement_index),]

cfb_ei <- cfb[-c(268,625),]
```


Algamation of all data transformations

```{r}
cfb$home_1sthalf <- cfb$home_1_pts + cfb$home_2_pts 
cfb$home_2ndhalf <- cfb$home_3_pts + cfb$home_4_pts

cfb$away_1sthalf <- cfb$away_1_pts + cfb$away_2_pts
cfb$away_2ndhalf <- cfb$away_3_pts + cfb$away_4_pts

cfb$margin_1sthalf <- cfb$home_1sthalf - cfb$away_1sthalf
cfb$margin_game <- cfb$home_points - cfb$away_points

cfb$comeback <- (cfb$margin_game / cfb$margin_1sthalf) < 0

```



Thought about looking at time but when we realized they were all in GMT, the effort to find the timezone for each stadium/home team and then change it is something we did not have time before.

```{r}
head(
  cfb %>%
  separate(col = start_date, into = c("date", "time"), sep = "T") %>%
  separate(col = date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  separate(col = time, into = c("hour", "minutes"), sep = ":")
)
```


```{r}
ggplot(cfb_ei, aes(x = excitement_index)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)

ggplot(cfb_ei, aes(x = excitement_index)) +
  stat_ecdf()
```


```{r}
ggplot(cfb_ei, aes(excitement_index, score_difference)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  ylim(0, 80)
```

```{r}
ggplot(cfb_ei, aes(home_points+away_points, excitement_index)) +
  geom_point()

cfb
```






```{r}
cfb_ei %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize(avg_excitement = mean(excitement_index)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = week, y = avg_excitement))

```



```{r}
cfb_ei %>%
  group_by(comeback) %>%
  summarise(avg_ei = mean(excitement_index)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(comeback, avg_ei)) +
  geom_col()

```
